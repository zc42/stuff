repo 4 ml stuff .. 
just trying to get some understanding of ml and python 
 - first ml impression .. it's time consuming .. u need to re-think your approach to project or task
 - first python impression [about syntax] it's fat.. prior java/c#/c++ .. and others

g15p -> my approach to solve a puzzle 15 .. 
well it's kinda done but not like i'm what it to be done 
[basically made model to memorize all possible moves .. ]
..but for now i need to stop with this one.. and maybe get more theory 
code style - corner cuts/spaghetti code/over engineering .. u name it [in my defense - i'm just learning]
