#### repo 4 ml stuff .. 
just trying to get some understanding of ml and python 
 - first ml impression .. it's time consuming .. u need to re-think your approach to project or task
 - first python impression [about syntax] it's fat.. 

g15p -> my approach to solve puzzle 15 .. 
it's kinda done, but not like i wanted it to be done 
[basically made model to memorize all possible moves .. ]
..but for now i need to stop with this one.. 
code style - corner cuts/spaghetti code/over engineering .. u name it [in my defense - i'm just learning]

- train model -> mdl-train.sh (go to code 4 details)
- test model -> mdl-test.sh   (self explanatory .. and go to code 4 details)

*****************************************
#### Done. 
Like i wanted it to be done .. 
- key idea: state compression. In order to create a manageable state space, states are compressed by retaining only the relevant information for task completion.
- code + some details: https://www.kaggle.com/code/zilvinasc/reinforced-learning-qtable-puzzle-15
